Meanwhile, Tomoya is shocked to learn that the girl he idolized as his muse for this whole project was none other than his boring classmate, Megumi Kato! But, this doesn\u0027t dissuade Tomoya. He is determined to give Megumi a total make-over within his game and raise her to be the absolute girlfriend that every man desires…!\r\n\r\n(Source: Aniplex USA)",

Meanwhile Midosuji has Ishigaki to work with. However Hakone has tricked them all. As soon as the climb is over Shinkai races to the front and is able to assist Fukutomi. Midosuji decides everyone around him must be zombies and hits Imaizumi\u0027s handlebars, making it looking like an accident and causing him to start to fall. Instead of falling, Imaizumi intentionally hits the rail to boost himself back up and keep riding. Imaizumi reveals he no longer cares about Midosuji and keeps riding, propelling Kinjou back into second place. Realizing that Imaizumi is no longer weak, Midosuji announces they\u0027ll cancel all phases and win solely based on their strength. No more tricks will be involved. The three teams remain neck-and-neck until Ishigaki begins to slip on the final turn. Surprisingly Midosuji catches him, and the momentum of the fall propels the two of them to the front with only 1200 meters left. \n",

One day she transforms into Cure Flora with \u0026quot;Dress Up Key\u0026quot; which Prince Kanata of Hope Kingdom gave her as a good luck charm when she was little.

His father brings over two beautiful step-sisters, but then embarks on an overseas trip. However, the two sisters Mio and Maria Naruse are actually a novice devil and succubus.\r\n\r\nBasara almost ends up forming a dangerous servant and master contract with them, but due to an error, the contract becomes reversed, and Basara becomes the master instead. To add to things, erotic situations continuously start to happen in Basara\u0027s life. However, it turns out Mio is having her life targeted by other monsters and heroes. And so, the \"desire/action\" tale of the strongest contractor begins. (Source: ANN)",

In the kitchen: that’s where you’ll mostly likely find second-year junior high school student Ryo Machiko, cooking delicious food for her friends to eat. It has been said that there’s no sincerer love than the love of food, and she loves eating it just as much as she loves making it. When she’s not doing the typical things a pre-teen does, Ryo is honing her skills in the culinary arts for her friends, Kirin and Shiina.  If the way to someone’s heart is through their stomach, Ryo will certainly win the heart of anyone she feeds. So, sit down with a healthy appetite because you’ll want to sink your teeth into and come back for seconds when watching GOURMET GIRL GRAFFITI!\r\n\r\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Gray-haired bartender Decim is responsible for judging the souls.\n\n“Welcome to Quin Decim.”\n\nWith no idea that they have died, two souls walk into the bar. Decim welcomes the customers, who are clueless as to what is going on. “I\u0027m going to ask you to bet your life and play games,” he declares. The souls must put their best efforts into playing various games for a chance to get out of the bar. Judgment will be based on the outcome of the games. As the games unfold, the souls\u0027 true colors are bared. At the end, Decim finally reveals that he is the judge. What judgment will he hand down to the two?\n\nVarious views on life and a spectrum of sorrows surface from the judged souls, and as he experiences these emotions with Dark-haired woman, the usually emotionless Decim begins to feel changes within himself.\n\nWhat is life really all about? What is man\u0027s true nature? The story unfolds as it poses these questions.",

        "synopsis": "Veteran gamer Shiroe and other players have been trapped in the world of the online game Elder Tales for six months. The once chaotic city of Akiba has regained its everyday hustle and bustle following the formation of the self-governing organization Round Table Meeting. The earthlings, who are originally from the game world, have gained the trust of Shiroe by waging a defensive war against the Goblins in Zantleaf Region. This has led Princess Rayneshia of the Cowen family, the highest-ranking Earthling Aristocrats, to live in Akiba.\n\nIt\u0027s almost winter and the Adventurers are thinking about what they\u0027re going to do and what their goals are in this other world. Will they remain in Akiba or go to the city of the West? Or will they travel to the land of the North or another faraway country? The opinions of the Adventurers begin to diverge. What adventures await the members of the Shiroe team in this second series of Log Horizon?\n\n(Source: NHK Enterprises) ",

            "synopsis": "Four years later in 1987, in Japan, a boy named Jotaro Kujo has willingly turned himself into jail, refusing to leave as he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. He proves this by mysteriously taking a police officer\u0027s gun and firing a bullet at his own head, only for it to be stopped in midair by a spectral hand. Noticing the hand herself when others cannot, Jotaro\u0027s mother, Holly, calls her father and Jotaro\u0027s grandfather, Joseph Joestar, who travels to Japan alongside an acquaintance from Egypt, Mohammed Avdol. After Jotaro refuses his grandfather\u0027s demands to leave the cell, Joseph leaves the task to Avdol, who summons an \"evil spirit\" of his own, an anthropomorphic bird engulfed in flames, which he refers to as Magician\u0027s Red. As Magician\u0027s Red uses force against Jotaro, whose own spirit tries to protect him, Joseph explains these \"spirits\" are actually manifestations of the user\u0027s own life force, which have come to be known as \"Stands\". Jotaro is eventually pushed into fighting back with his Stand, breaking apart the prison bars, at which point Avdol withdraws from the fight, having achieved his goal of getting Jotaro out of his cell. Later, Joseph reveals to Jotaro and Holly that the Speedwagon Foundation has been investigating the disappearance of a shipwreck salvage crew and the discovery of an empty coffin. It was in this coffin that a man of pure evil known as Dio has been in slumber, until he was brought back to the surface. Joseph then uses a Stand of his own, resembling purple brambles, to smash an expensive instant camera, from which a photograph appears. After explaining how people from the Joestar bloodline have star-shaped birthmarks on the back of their necks, Joseph reveals the photograph to be a picture of Dio possessing the same birthmark, showing that he had stolen the body of his grandfather, Jonathan Joestar, as his own. He goes on to state that Dio\u0027s revival has caused the emergence of Stands in both himself and Jotaro, though Holly claims nothing has happened to her, whilst Avdol states he has had his Stand since birth. As the group decides to rest before tracking down Dio, Jotaro tries to take all this information in, as well as knowing Joseph and Avdol will be living with them for some time. Meanwhile, somewhere in the world, Dio senses that he is being watched by the Joestars and resolves to kill them. ",

When club members Atsushi Kinugawa and En Yufuin were chilling out while soaking in the hot tub at the bathhouse Kurotamayu, a pink beast (Wombat) suddenly appeared out of thin air. “I want to save this planet... can you please lend me your strength?” The two feel the mood has been ruined by Wombat who talks to them in Japanese about how he wants to save Earth with the power of love. Just then, the son of the bathhouse owner Yumoto Hakone shows up, and as soon as he sees Wombat, he chases it, screaming “Let me fluff you up!” The next day, Kinugawa and Yufuin are caught by Wombat once again at school along with the other club members Io Naruko and Ryu Zaou.. Bracelets were clasped onto the wrist of these four, along with Yumoto Hakone who bumped into them chasing after Wombat, with a command that they must save the earth. “It\u0027s about love-making!” they hear as a bright light emanating from the bracelet envelops their entire bodies, and the five transform into “Battle Lovers”, the heirs of the throne of love...\r\n\r\n(Source: ANN)",

She assists people of all walks of life with the help of her two familiars: a succubus and an incubus with great powers of seduction. Though she seeks only peace, the archangel Michael despises her use of magic to interfere in human affairs and decrees that should she ever manage to lose her virginity, Maria\u0027s powers will vanish! To ensure that Maria no longer mingles magic with humans, Michael sends the angel Ezekiel to keep a watchful eye on the virgin witch.\n\n(Source: FUNimation)",
